# What Does It Do?
It reads the contents of the given YAML and provides easy means to update it. The screen is divided into three parts: _Services_, _Settings_, and _Info_. _Services_ contains a list of detected Minecraft settings from the input YAML. _Settings_ contains a form in which you can edit the fields of the YAML. _Info_ tries to given some help on the currently active control's function.
